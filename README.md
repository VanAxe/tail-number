# tail-number

![](./media/tail-number.jpg)

Tail numbers allow you to identify individual planes, even if they look all very similar.

This program means to automate or simplify most operations related to upstream dependency management in loosely coupled CI/CD pipelines. Specifically this program is built with love for Concourse.

Tail-number centers around two types of operations :

* __Dependency operations__ which focuses on managing upstream dependency and version bumps.

* __Branch operations__ which focuses on performing validation on commits and merging branches.
