# tail-number

Tail numbers allow you to identify individual planes, even if they mostly look all the same.

This program means to automate or simplify most operations related to upstream dependency management in loosely coupled automated CI/CD pipelines with systems like Concourse.

Tail number centers around two types of operations :

* __Dependency operations__ which focus on managing upstream dependency and version bumps.

* __Branch operations__ which focuses on performing validation on commits and merging branches.
